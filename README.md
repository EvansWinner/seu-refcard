# SEU refcard

The file seu-refcard.org provides a quick reference card for IBM's
*seu* text editor.  The file is in Emacs org-mode syntax and can be
exported from Emacs using org-mode 8 (or possible earlier or later
versions) using function `org-latex-export-to-pdf`.  The resulting pdf
file should fit on a single page of US letter sized paper, suitable
for printing.

Heck, I might as well include the PDF file in git... so I will.
